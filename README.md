## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Graphical Mode
* **Smart Plotting:** Automatically detects and renders **2D curves** (e.g., `y = sin(x)`) and **3D surfaces** (e.g., `z = sin(x) * cos(y)`).
* **Real-Time Analysis:** As you type, it instantly calculates and displays:
    * **Roots** (x-intercepts) for 2D functions.
    * **Y-Intercepts** (`f(0)`).
    * **Arithmetic Results** (if a simple calculation like `2+2` is entered).
* **Media Tools:** Built-in controls to **Take Screenshots** 📸 and **Record Screen Videos** 🎥 of your graphs directly from the browser.
* **Magic Graphs:** A preset menu featuring 10 complex mathematical visualizations to demonstrate rendering capabilities.

### 🧮 Simple Mode
* **Clean Interface:** A distraction-free, traditional calculator layout for quick computations.
* **History Tracking:** Displays previous calculation steps above the current result.

### 🎨 UI/UX & Theming
* **Dark/Light Mode:** A global theme toggle that adjusts the entire UI for optimal visibility in any lighting.
* **Expanded Function Panel:** A comprehensive panel containing advanced functions grouped by category (Trigonometry, Statistics, Calculus, Number Theory, etc.).
